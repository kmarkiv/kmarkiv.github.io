### About Me

I recently graduated with a Ph.D. candidate from the school of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon. I specialize in Human-Computer Interaction for Development (HCI4D).

Prof. [Amy Ogan](https://www.amyogan.com/) and Prof. [Tim Brown](https://www.africa.engineering.cmu.edu/about/contact/directory/bios/brown-tim.html) were my amazing advisors. We work on building and evaluating low-cost technology to support teachers in low-resource contexts.

I recently passed my thesis defense. Here is the draft of my [thesis document]({{site.thesis_link}}).

I aspire to be a friendly neighborhood HCI/ICTD citizen.

### Swimming

I am a long-distance swimmer, and I have raised money for charity by partnering with NGOs in India. You can read more about my adventures on my [blog](https://kmarkiv.wordpress.com/2017/06/21/swimming-10-miles-from-elephanta-island-to-gateway-of-india-for-acid-attack/){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener"}. Here are some selected swims. 

*   Elephanta to gateway of India for supporting acid attack victims.
*   Swim Miami 2016 for buying wheelchairs for differently-abled people.
*   Swim Miami 2021 for covid relief.
*   Across lake Muhazi in Rwanda for fun.

### Software development

Over the past 15 years, I have built technology on the web, Android, desktop, iOS, and hardware gadgets. I still love to make things but rarely do it for projects outside my research these days. After more than a decade of fancy portfolios, I decided to keep it simple this time.

Here are some selected projects:

*   Flask APIs at scale: APIs that served 4 million users at TeliportMe (where I was the Architect)
*   WebGL viewer: I designed a 3D viewer for phone and web browsers on par with Google street view.
*   Learn Kannada: An android application to teach a second language that has >10K downloads.
*   Textin: A desktop application to send text messages and my first entrepreneurship venture
*   Enginux: I helped build a custom Ubuntu derivative based on Linux Mint.
*   Jedi Mouse: An interactive device that uses gestures and EEG data from the brain from the user to control the mouse.

### Hobbies

*   Cooking: I am good at cooking South Indian food, but I occasionally try vegetarian cuisines from other cultures.
*   Sketching: I love to draw cartoon characters, and I usually draw them with a positive message.
*   Meditation: I follow the heartfulness practice regularly.
*   Learning French: As much as I can.
*   Chess: I play Blitz and Bullet on chess.com
