## Welcome

I am a PhD Student at School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon. I specialize in Human-Computer Interaction for Development (HCI4D). I am lucky to be advised by Prof. Tim Brown and Prof. Amy Ogan. We work on building and evaluating technology to support marginalized users in a developmental context, mostly in health care and education. 

I am also a long distance swimmer and I have been able to raise money for charity by swimming across channels on many occasions for people in need in India. 

I have built products for the web, Android, desktop, iOS and hardware gadgets. Read my story and portfolio if you are interested in knowing more about me. I am grateful that my work has been featured in the media. You can also have a look at my apps on Google Play or visit my Github.
