### Swimming
I am a long distance swimmer and I have raised money for charity by swimming across channels on many occasions for people in need in India. 

### Coding
I have built products for the web, Android, desktop, iOS and hardware gadgets. Read my story and portfolio if you are interested in knowing more about me. I am grateful that my work has been featured in the media. You can also have a look at my apps on Google Play or visit my Github.
