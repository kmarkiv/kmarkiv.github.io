### About Me

I am a postdoctoral fellow at Saarland University, advised by Prof. [Ingmar Weber](https://ingmarweber.de/). I specialize in Human-Computer Interaction for Development (HCI4D).

I recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science. Prof. [Amy Ogan](https://www.amyogan.com/) and Prof. [Tim Brown](https://www.africa.engineering.cmu.edu/about/contact/directory/bios/brown-tim.html) were my amazing advisors. We worked on building and evaluating low-cost technology to support teachers in low-resource contexts. Here is the draft of my [thesis document]({{site.thesis_link}}).

I aspire to be a friendly neighborhood HCI/ICTD citizen.

### Swimming

I am a long-distance swimmer and have raised money for charity by partnering with NGOs in India. You can read more about my adventures on my [blog](https://kmarkiv.wordpress.com/2017/06/21/swimming-10-miles-from-elephanta-island-to-gateway-of-india-for-acid-attack/){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener"}. Here are some selected swims. 

*   Elephanta to Gateway of India for supporting acid attack victims.
*   Swim Miami 2016 for buying wheelchairs for differently-abled people.
*   Swim Miami 2021 for COVID relief.
*   Across Lake Muhazi in Rwanda for fun.

### Software development

Over the past 15 years, I have built technology on the web, Android, desktop, iOS, and hardware gadgets. I still love making things but rarely do it for projects outside my research. After over a decade of fancy portfolios, I kept it simple this time.

Here are some selected projects:

*   Flask APIs at scale: APIs that served 4 million users at TeliportMe (where I was the Architect)
*   WebGL viewer: I designed a 3D viewer for phones and web browsers that is on par with Google Street View.
*   Learn Kannada: An Android application to teach a second language with>10K downloads.
*   Textin: A desktop application to send text messages and my first entrepreneurship venture
*   Enginux: I helped build a custom Ubuntu derivative based on Linux Mint.
*   Jedi Mouse: An interactive device that uses gestures and EEG data from the user's brain to control the mouse.

### Hobbies

*   Cooking: I am good at cooking South Indian food but occasionally try vegetarian cuisines from other cultures.
*   Sketching: I love to draw cartoon characters, usually with a positive message.
*   Meditation: I follow the heartfulness practice regularly.
*   Learning French and German: As much as I can.
*   Chess: I play Blitz and Bullet on chess.com
