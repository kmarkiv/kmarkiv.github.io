                        I am a PhD Student at School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon. I specialize in Human-Computer Interaction for Development (HCI4D). I am lucky to be advised by  <a href="https://www.africa.engineering.cmu.edu/_files/faculty-and-staff-bios/timothy-x-brown.html" target="_blank" >Prof. Tim Brown</a> and <a href="https://www.amyogan.com/" target="_blank"> Prof. Amy Ogan</a>  . We work on building and evaluating technology to support marginalized users in a developmental context, mostly in health care and education.

                          I am also a long distance swimmer and I have been able to <a href="http://kmarkiv.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">raise money for charity by swimming across channels </a> on many occasions for people in need in India.
